  <p>
    I'm a 29 year old developer living with my wife and daughter in Round Rock, Texas. I've been working on computers since I could use a keyboard and mouse, and picked up web development in middle school. For some reason, I went to school for Business Administration at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo and received my bachelor's degree in December of 2011. I gained all of my development knowledge and experience through copious amounts of reading, tutorials, and pet projects until I was hired for my first professional programming job 3 months into 2012. I've worked hard and made career moves when work became stagnant and unchallenging. 
  </p>
  <p>
    While work drives me and keeps my mind eager and agile, my family is why I work as hard as I do. I met my wife in San Luis Obispo as a freshman, and 6 years later propsed in Redondo Beach, CA. We were married a year later, where she followed me to Texas when work pulled us from California. Half a year later she told me she was pregnant and in April of 2016 our daughter was born.
